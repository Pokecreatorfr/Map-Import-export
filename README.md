mapextractor.py:
    No problem you can use it without worries, it has no impact on the rom and I didn't notice any corrupted map files.
mapimporter.py: 
    everything is functional however I do not advise to use it for your rom because I have not done enough testing, if you use it you can send me your feedback on discord.
